1. GENERAL INFORMATION

2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions

Trip 
The unit of travel, a trip, is defined as a one-way course of travel with a single main purpose. For example: the distance travelled from home to work is one trip only regardless of whether one or more means of transport are used.

Stage 
A trip consists of one or more stages. A new stage is defined when there is a change in the form of transport or when there is a change of vehicle.

Regular trips
Regular trips concern the daily mobility in the Netherlands of the Dutch population aged 6 years and over in private households. This includes domestic holiday mobility. Successive work-related movements with a maximum of 3 consecutive work locations, are also included. Series of calls trips and (professional) road transport with a heavy freight vehicle are not considered regular trips.

Regular passenger kilometres
Regular passenger kilometres are the kilometres travelled during regular trips. It only concerns kilometres travelled on Dutch territory. Regular passenger kilometres by mode of transport have been calculated on the basis of the stage mode so that the distances of means of transport used for pre- and post-transport are also measured separately. For example, in the case of a journey from home to work with successively the bicycle to the station, the train and on foot to the office, the kilometres travelled by a stage mode of transport are assigned to the relevant mode of transport. Kilometres by plane are not counted.

Series of calls trips 
In order to reduce the burden on respondents in ODiN, travel involving 4 or more consecutive stops for the same main purpose ‘in course of work’ are treated as one continuous series of calls trip. Series of call trips are made, for example, by taxi drivers, parcel deliverers or a doctor’s round. Professional (series) trips with a heavy freight vehicle are not included in the calculation.

Domestic holiday mobility
Domestic holiday mobility concerns mobility in the Netherlands of the Dutch population because of holidays. These are both trips due to holidays in the Netherlands and the kilometres travelled on the way there or the way back on Dutch territory during a holiday abroad. Holidays are defined as staying outside your own home for relaxation or fun other than with family or acquaintances spent at home. Domestic holiday mobility is part of the regular passenger kilometres and of regular trips.
