A trip, is  a one-way course of travel with a single main purpose  regardless of whether one or more means of transport are used. Switching to another mode of transport does not count as a new trip. In tables showing trips in combination with mode of transport, the main mode of transport is used. For trips made with multiple modes of transport, the vehicle with which the longest distance has been travelled is the main mode of transport. For example, when travelling from home to work with successively the bicycle (3 km) to the station, the train (50 km) and on foot (1 km) to the office, the entire trip is counted as one train trip of 54 km.
